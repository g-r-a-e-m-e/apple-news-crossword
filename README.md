# Apple News+ Crossword Daily Crossword Performance Analysis

Some friends and I are competetive and nerdy, so we care about tracking and improving around our "crossword performance."

`data/apple-news-daily-crossword-data.csv/` is the location of the most up-to-date data file. This should be updated daily.

`python/` is the directory for the analysis pipeline.

Starting small, but who knows where this project might wind up?

## Requirements
1. A LaTeX compiler is necessary to generate the .pdf.
2. A Sense of humor.

## Usage
1. Clone the repo to wherever you want it
2. `$ cd <repo-directory>`
3. `$ python3 -m venv venv`
4. `$ source venv/bin/activate`
5. `$ python3 python/analysis.py`
